#
# This file recalculates the word frequency counts in
# Alexandre Girardi's "wordfreq" file. (1998)
#
# This is what I did.
# The counts for the various forms of the same word were merged.
# Certain words/items were removed: numbers, English and romaji,
# punctuation, phrases ending in the particle "wo", lines beginning with
# "n" or the particle "wo."
# Then the file was sorted by "the count."
#
# The most fequently used word was used 3,711,420 times.
#    592 words were used more than 10,000 times.
#  5,039 words were used more than 1,000 times.
#  7,654 words were used more than 500 times.
# 19,602 words were used more than 100 times.
# 26,813 words were used more than 50 times.
# 38,389 words were used more than 20 times.

# The data contains 142,298 lines in the following format.
